# my-type-and-about-me
a little about me, I'm in the phase where I want to be rich in dating, but I'm afraid of failing again, to be honest in my last relationship, it just made me afraid, why???
I'm scared of being left behind again, I'm the one who kept him in the process, I'm the one who was left behind, thrown away like trash, not appreciated at all, I've lowered my standards as a woman, begging, and that's the reason I'm afraid of starting with someone new, I I'm afraid I'll fail again.
and another thing from learning in my last relationship, I learned a lot, I think about it, I'm generous, I put in the effort, I'm willing to lower my standards as a wife for him, in reality, everything I give him is not appreciated In fact, he is more concerned about himself than his relationship.
And no matter how old a guy is, it doesn't guarantee that he's an adult, why? Sometimes there are guys who are old enough but their thinking is still immature "age doesn't guarantee that a guy is an adult or not yet."
